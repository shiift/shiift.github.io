During the summer of 2015 I worked for an online marketplace, [1stdibs.com](https://www.1stdibs.com), which specializes in antiques, designer items, and fine art. The company started as a kind of advertising business for dealers in the New York City area, but has grown to become a leader in e-commerce for antique and fine art dealers around the world. During my time at 1stdibs I learned Javascript along with many front-end development tools, workflows and coding conventions.

My responsibilities at 1stdibs included:

* Implmeneting design changes and new website features
* Writing unit tests in Jasmine and more specialized integration tests (to verify back-end service behavior)
* Using React, Backbone, and Node.js to create tools for developers (Chrome extensions, test result database, etc.)
