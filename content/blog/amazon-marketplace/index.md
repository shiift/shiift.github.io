During my first year at Amazon I worked in the Marketplace organization on the Seller Pricing team. I started on the Seller Pricing team in Marketplace developing systems that react to price change events for third party sellers on Amazon.com. These systems controlled features ranging from real-time price error handling, to seller facing APIs, to pricing-related dashboards.
