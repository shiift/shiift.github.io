More recently I have worked on the Amazon Spark team where we launched our product allowing people to discover, share, and shop their interests. On this team I have worked to develop many features including adding products on Spark to the Amazon wishlist, tagged interest recommendations while posting, and integration with partner teams such as Amazon Ask (Question and Answers).
