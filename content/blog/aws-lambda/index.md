I lead the workload routing system in the AWS Lambda data plane which assigns more than 300 billion incoming function invokes per day to Firecracker MicroVMs to execute customer code for hundreds of thousands of customers. I am directly responsible for hiring, mentoring, coaching, and performance evaluations for the team of ten to fifteen engineers, defining the teamâ€™s forward looking technical roadmap, and ensuring stable, agile, and maintainable service operations. I led the team in the completion of a multi-year, multimillion-dollar replacement architecture for the data plane service to increase resilience against zonal outages, while improving durability of routing during host failures with multi-second failover.
