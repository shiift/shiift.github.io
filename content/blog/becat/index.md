BECAT is a computing research center at the University of Connecticut. I began work with the BECAT support team as the technical support person for the department, however, more recently I have been focusing my attention toward helping the team with management of the computing cluster and creating tools for managing users of the cluster.

My responsibilities at BECAT included:
* Help with High Performance Computing (HPC) support and overall cluster management (Linux server management).
* Providing technical support for issues including viruses, network problems, and malfunctioning hardware.
* Maintaining personal computer systems for staff, faculty and students in the BECAT Research Center.
