During the summers of my freshman and sophomore years at UConn I worked at United Technologies Aerospace Systems where I worked on the F-15 weapons control system called the PACS (Programmable Armament Control Set). This system is an embedded system that has been developed by United Technologies for many contries for decades. I was fortunate enough to get an opportunity to work with a very experienced team of embedded software engineers and testers to work on the newest version of this system for a few different countries.

My responsibilities at UTC included:

* Extensively testing the PACS unit for software and hardware bugs through autorig simulations and test log analysis.
* Writing macros, automated CTLS scripts and Perl scripts for testing of the PACS unit and presenting results at weekly meetings.
* Discussing various requirements and code issues with the project manager and test lead.
